# Spotlob

Spotlob is a package to provide a simple, yet flexible
and fast workflow to measure properties of features in
images for scientific purposes.
It provides implementations for some use cases but can
be easily tuned and be extended towards specific purposes.
Jupyter notebook widgets can be used to quickly find a
set of algorithms and parameters that work for a given
image and should also work for similar images.
The set of parameters and algorithms are stored as a
pipeline which can be restored and distributed and 
then be applied to a possibly large set of images.
This way, standard routines for repetitive and comparable
measurements for a defined type of images can be forged
into a small and portable file.

## Getting started
## Basic workflow
### 1. Tweak parameters using the notebook
### 2. Store and reload a pipeline
### 3. Batch processing
## Extending functionality
