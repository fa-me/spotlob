# Contributing

Contributions are welcome in the form of pull requests.
If you make a pull request please make sure that

* it does not alter the overall idea of spotlob
* it is marked with "WIP" as long as you do not wish it to be merged
* it contains a good description of what features are added or which bugs are adressed. Think of adding and linking issues where suitable
* the commits are small and have an understandable message
* test coverage is not reduced. Adding tests for existing code is highly appreciated
* you add or change the documentation, where necessary. Adding docstrings for existing code is also highly appreciated
* you add major changes to the changelog
* add your name to the list of contributors

At the moment Fabian Meyer (fabian.meyer@ise.fraunhofer.de) is the only maintainer
and this is a side-project, so please be patient if review might take long.

With any suggestions for future features or bug reports, feel free to contact the maintainer
by mail or open an issue.
